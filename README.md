# README Template

> A template for writing useful READMEs

## Features

This is a quick copy and paste README template, including guidance on:

- Writing a getting started guide for your project
- Providing support information
- Writing contribution guidelines
- Following a code of conduct
- Providing a license for your software

## Getting Started

To use the template copy the contents of [README-template.md], save it as `README.md` in the root of your project, and use your text editor to edit the document as necessary.

You can also easily copy the file from your terminal using `curl`. From the root of your project directory, run the following command:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ascott1/readme-template/master/README-template.md > README.md
```
